Installation
============

To use this plugin, all you have to do is add this to your project use the PhoneGap CLI:

```
phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/j-mcnally/cordova-statusTap
```
The CLI tooling sets up all JS file references, and the plugin will initialize itself.  

Then to add a listener for the tap implement after PhoneGap/Cordova's onDeviceReady has been fired:

```
window.addEventListener("statusTap", function() {
  alert("status tap");
});
```

If you want to scroll a div based on this event, you can do something like the following (note, this is jQuery syntax):

```
window.addEventListener("statusTap", function() {
	var target = $("#scroller");
	
	//disable touch scroll
	target.css({
		'-webkit-overflow-scrolling' : 'auto',
		'overflow-y' : 'hidden'
	});
	
	//animate
	target.animate({ scrollTop: 0}, 300, "swing", function(){
		
		//re-enable touch scrolling
		target.css({
			'-webkit-overflow-scrolling' : 'touch',
			'overflow-y' : 'scroll'
		});
	});
});
```

This disables touch scrolling to kill an inertial scrolling in progress, animates it, then re-enables touch scrolling once the animation is complete.



That's it... very simple.
